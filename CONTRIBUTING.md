## 🧩 Contributing Widgets

To contribute widgets:

1. **Create a directory** under `repository/` named exactly after your GitHub username. For example:
   ```
   repository/username/
   ```

2. **Add your widget definitions** in YAML format inside your directory.  To avoid key collisions, it is strongly recommended to prefix all widget keys with your username, e.g., `username_widgetkey1`.

3. **Validate your YAML**: Make sure each widget file is syntactically correct and valid. Invalid YAML will be directly rejected. It should also comply with the syntax of the Widget definition API.

4. **Include custom styles** (if applicable): If your widgets use any CSS classes that are **not standard Bootstrap**, include **all custom styles in a single file** named `styles.css` in the same directory.

   Directory example:
   ```
   repository/username/
   ├── widget1.yml
   ├── widget2.yml
   └── styles.css   # only if needed
   ```

5. **Do not edit other users' directories or widgets** unless you're fixing a bug with permission.

## ✅ Pull Requests

When ready:

1. Push your changes to your fork.
2. Open a **Pull Request to the `develop` branch** of the main repo.
3. Clearly explain your changes and why they are useful.
4. Reference any related issues (e.g., `Closes #12`).

**Note**: PRs targeting `master` will be automatically closed.
